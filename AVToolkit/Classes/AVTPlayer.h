 A simple class making it easier to work with audio and video on iOS 6 (or later), without having to deal with reachability, reconnections, failed items, etc.
 
 To handle failures and such, you should look into these notifications:
 
 * **AVTPlayerFailedToPlayNotification**
   
   Posted when the item failed to load more than 10 times, while the host was reachable.
 
 * **AVTPlayerFailedToActivateSessionNotification**
 
   Posted when the audio session activation request was denied for some reason. The `userInfo` dictionary contains the key `error` containing the resulting NSError.
 
 * **AVTPlayerHostReachableNotification**
 
   Posted when the host of the current URL is reachable.
 
 * **AVTPlayerHostUnreachableNotification**
 
   Posted when the host of the current URL isn't reachable.
